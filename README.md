# **Experiment Report: Fundamentals and Evolution of Generative Artificial Intelligence**

---

## **1. Foundational Concepts of Generative AI**

### **1.1 What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?**

Artificial Intelligence refers to the ability of machines to simulate human intelligence processes such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

---

### **1.2 What is Generative AI?**

**Generative AI** is a subfield of AI focused on creating **new content** rather than just analyzing or classifying existing data.
The generated content can include:

* Text
* Images
* Audio
* Video
* Code
* Synthetic data

Unlike traditional AI systems that predict labels or outcomes, generative AI **learns the underlying patterns of data and produces new, original outputs**.

**Example:**

* ChatGPT generating human-like text
* DALL·E creating images from text prompts

---

### **1.3 What is a Generative Model?**

A **Generative Model** is a machine learning model that learns the **probability distribution of a dataset** and uses it to generate new data points that resemble the original data.

Mathematically, it learns:

> **P(X)** – the probability distribution of data

---

### **1.4 Types of Generative Models**

#### **1.4.1 Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)**

* Classical statistical models
* Represent data as a mixture of multiple Gaussian distributions
* Used in clustering and density estimation

---

#### **1.4.2 Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)**

* Used for sequence generation
* Common in speech recognition and time-series data

---

#### **1.4.3 Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**

* Neural network-based generative models
* Encode data into a latent space and decode it back
* Useful for image generation and anomaly detection

---

#### **1.4.4 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**

* Consist of two neural networks:

  * **Generator**: creates fake data
  * **Discriminator**: distinguishes real from fake
* Both compete, improving each other
* Widely used for image and video generation

---

#### **1.4.5 Transformer-based Models**

* Use attention mechanisms
* Power modern LLMs
* Examples: GPT, BERT, PaLM
